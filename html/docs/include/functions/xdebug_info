FUNC_ALL

This function returns an HTML page which shows diagnostic information. It is
analogous to PHP's <a href='https://php.net/phpinfo'>phpinfo()</a> function.

The HTML output includes which mode is active, what the settings are, and
diagnostic information in case there are problems with debugging connections,
opening of files, etc.

Each warning and error in the diagnostics log also links through to the
[FEAT:errors] documentation page.
