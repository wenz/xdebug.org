FUNC_STEP_DEBUG

TXT:
This function makes the debugger break on the line it is called from, as if a
normal file/line breakpoint was set on this line through the debugger protocol.

TXT:
If no debugging session is active yet, and [CFG:start_upon_request] is set to
<code>trigger</code>, then Xdebug will attempt to start a new debugging session
first.

TXT:
The function returns <code>true</code> if a debugging session is (now) active,
and the breakpoint was succesfully set. It returns <code>false</code> if a
debugging session was not active and could not be activated.
