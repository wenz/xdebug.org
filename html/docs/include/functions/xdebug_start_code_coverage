FUNC_CODE_COVERAGE

TXT:
This function starts gathering the information for code coverage. The information
can be retrieved with the [FUNC:xdebug_get_code_coverage] function.

TXT:
This function has three options, which act as a bitfield:

<dl>
<dt>XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED</dt>
<dd>Enables scanning of code to figure out which line has executable code.
Without this option the returned array will only have lines in them that were
actually executed.</dd>

<dt>XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE</dt>
<dd>Enables branch analyzes to figure out whether code can be executed.</dd>

<dt>XDEBUG_CC_BRANCH_CHECK</dt>
<dd>Enables branch and path execution analysis.</dd>
</dl>

The options to analyse PHP code will reduce PHP's performance. These options
also only have effect on code coverage analyses for functions, methods, or
scripts started <b>after</b> the call to [FUNC:xdebug_start_code_coverage], and
have no effect on the function where [FUNC:xdebug_start_code_coverage] is
called in.

TXT:
You can use the options as shown in the following example.

EXAMPLE:
<?php
xdebug_start_code_coverage( XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED | XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE );
?>
