FUNC_FUNCTION_TRACE

TXT:
Start tracing function calls from this point to the file in the
<code>$trace_file</code> parameter. If no filename is given, then the trace file will
be placed in the directory as configured by the [CFG:output_dir] setting.

TXT:
In case a file name is given as first parameter, the name is relative
to the current working directory. This current working directory might be
different than you expect it to be, so please use an absolute path in case you
specify a file name. Use the PHP function <a
href='http://php.net/getcwd'>getcwd()</a> to figure out what the current
working directory is.

TXT:
The name of the trace file is <code>{$trace_file}.xt</code>. If the trace was started at
the beginning of the request because [CFG:start_with_request] is set to
<code>yes</code>, then the filename depends on the
[CFG:trace_output_name] setting.

TXT:
The <i>options</i> parameter is a bitfield;
currently there are three options:

The <i>options</i> parameter is a bitfield;
currently there are three options:

<dl>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_APPEND (1)</dt>
<dd>makes the trace file open in append mode rather than
overwrite mode</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_COMPUTERIZED (2)</dt>
<dd>creates a trace file with
the format as described under <i>1</i> "[CFG:trace_format]".</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_HTML (4)</dt>
<dd>creates a trace file as an HTML table</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME (8)</dt>
<dd>Normally, Xdebug always adds ".xt" to the end of the filename that you
pass in as first argument to this function. With the
<i>XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME</i> flag set, ".xt" is not added.</dd>
</dl>

TXT:
The settings [CFG:collect_assignments], [CFG:collect_includes],
[CFG:collect_params] and [CFG:collect_return] influence what information is
logged to the trace file and the setting [CFG:trace_format] influences the
format of the trace file.

TXT:
The full path and filename to which Xdebug traces is returned from this
function. This will be either the filename you pass in (potentially with ".xt"
added), or the auto generated filename if no filename has been passed in.
