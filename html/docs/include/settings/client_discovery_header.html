<p>If [CFG:client_discovery_header] is configured to be a non-empty string, then the
value is used as key in the <code>$_SERVER</code> superglobal array to determine
which header to use to find the IP address or hostname to use for 'connecting
back to'. This setting is only used in combination with
[CFG:discover_client_host] and is otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>For example, if [CFG:client_discovery_header] is set to <code>FORWARD_HOST</code>,
then Xdebug will check <code>$_SERVER['FORWARD_HOST']</code> before the
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> variables.</p>
