<p>This setting, defaulting to 0, controls whether Xdebug should collect
the parameters passed to functions when a function call is recorded in either
the function trace or the stack trace.</p>
<p>The setting defaults to 0 because for very large
scripts it may use huge amounts of memory and therefore make it impossible for
the huge script to run. You can most safely turn this setting on, but you can
expect some problems in scripts with a lot of function calls and/or huge data
structures as parameters. Xdebug 2 will not have this problem with increased
memory usage, as it will never store this information in memory. Instead it
will only be written to disk. This means that you need to have a look at the
disk usage though.</p>
<p>This setting can have four different values. For each of the values a
different amount of information is shown. Below you will see what information
each of the values provides. See also the introduction of the feature
[FEAT:develop#stack_trace] for a few screenshots.</p>
<table class='table'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Argument Information Shown</th></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>0</td><td>None.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>1</td><td>Type and number of elements (f.e. string(6), array(8)).</td></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>2</td><td><p>Type and number of elements, with a tool tip for the full information <sup>1</sup>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>3</td><td>Full variable contents (with the limits respected as set by [CFG:var_display_max_children], [CFG:var_display_max_data] and [CFG:var_display_max_depth].</td></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>4</td><td>Full variable contents and variable name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='ctr'>5</td><td>PHP serialized variable contents, without the name.</td></tr>
</table>
<p><sup>1</sup></a> in the CLI version of PHP it will not have the tool tip, nor in output files.</p>
