<p>Controls which IDE Key Xdebug should pass on to the debugging client or
proxy. The IDE Key is only important for use with the [FEAT:dbgpProxy],
although some IDEs are incorrectly picky as to what its value is.</p>

<p>The default is based on the <code>DBGP_IDEKEY</code> environment setting. If
it is not present, the default falls back to an empty string.</p>

<p>If this setting is set to a non-empty string, it selects its value over
<code>DBGP_IDEKEY</code> environment variable as default value.</p>

<p>The internal IDE Key also gets updated through debugging session management
and overrides the value of this setting as is explained in the
[FEAT:step_debug#activate_debugger] documentation.</p>

<p class="note">This setting can additionally be configured through the
<code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>
<a href="/docs/all_settings#XDEBUG_CONFIG">environment variable</a>.</p>
