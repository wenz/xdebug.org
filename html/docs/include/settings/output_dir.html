<p>The directory where Xdebug will write tracing, profiling, and garbage
collection statistics to. This directory needs to be writable for the system
user with which PHP is running.</p>
<p>This setting can be changed in <code>php.ini</code>, <code>.htaccess</code>
(and equivalent files), and within a PHP file with <code>ini_set()</code>.</p>
<p>In some cases (when profiling, or when
[CFG:start_with_request]=<code>yes</code> with tracing), Xdebug
creates the file before the script runs. In that case, changes made through
<code>ini_set()</code> will not be taken into account.</p>

<p class="note">This setting can additionally be configured through the
<code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>
<a href="/docs/all_settings#XDEBUG_CONFIG">environment variable</a>.</p>
