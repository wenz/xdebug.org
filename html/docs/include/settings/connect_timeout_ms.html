<p>The amount of time in milliseconds that Xdebug will wait for on an
IDE to acknowledge an incoming debugging connection. The default value of 200
ms should in most cases be enough. In case you often get dropped debugging
requests, perhaps because you have a high latency network, or a development box
far away from your IDE, or have a slow firewall, then you can should increase
this value.</p>
<p>Please note that increasing this value might mean that your requests seem to
'hang' in case Xdebug tries to establish a connection, but your IDE is not
listening.</p>
