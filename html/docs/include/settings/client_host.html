<p>Configures the IP address or hostname where Xdebug will attempt to connect to when initiating a
debugging connection. This address should be the address of the machine where your IDE or debugging
client is listening for incoming debugging connections.</p>
<p>On non-Windows platforms, it is also possible to configure a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix domain socket</a> which is supported by
only a select view debugging clients. In that case, instead of the hostname or IP address, use
<code>unix:///path/to/sock</code>.</p>
<p>If [CFG:discover_client_host] is enabled then Xdebug will only use the value of this setting in
case Xdebug can not connect to an IDE using the information it obtained from HTTP headers. In that
case, the value of this setting acts as a fallback only.</p>

<p class="note">This setting can additionally be configured through the
<code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>
<a href="/docs/all_settings#XDEBUG_CONFIG">environment variable</a>.</p>
