<p>The port to which Xdebug tries to connect on the remote host. Port
<code>9003</code> is the default for both Xdebug and the [FEAT:dbgpClient].

<p class="note">This setting can additionally be configured through the
<code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>
<a href="/docs/all_settings#XDEBUG_CONFIG">environment variable</a>.</p>
