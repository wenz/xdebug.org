<p>
Xdebug's code coverage functionality is often used in combination with
<a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage">PHP_CodeCoverage</a>
as part of <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> runs. PHPUnit delegates
the code coverage collection to Xdebug. It starts and stops code coverage
through [FUNC:xdebug_start_code_coverage] and [FUNC:xdebug_stop_code_coverage]
for every test, and uses [FUNC:xdebug_get_code_coverage] to retrieve the
results.
</p>
<p>
Code coverage's main output is an array detailing which lines in which files
have been "hit" while running the code with code coverage collection active.
But the code coverage functionality can also, with an additional performance
impact, analyse which lines of code have executable code on it, which lines of
code can actually be hit (dead code analysis), and also can it do
instrumentation to find out which branches and paths in functions and methods
have been followed. The various options are documented with the
[FUNC:xdebug_start_code_coverage] function.

<h2>Filtering <a name="coverage-filter" href="#coverage-filter">#</a></h2>
<p>
Xdebug 2.6 introduces filtering capabilities for code coverage. With a filter
you can include, or exclude, paths or class name prefixes (namespaces) from
being analysed during code coverage collection. A
typyical use case would be to configure the filter to only include your
<code>src/</code> folder, so that Xdebug's code coverage analysis does not try
to analyse tests, Composer dependencies, or PHPUnit/PHP_CodeCoverage itself. If
you configure the filter correctly, you can expect a 2-fold speed increase for
code coverage runs

</p>
<p>
The filter works by tagging each executable unit (function, method, file)
according to the configured filter. Xdebug can only do that the first time a
specific executable unit is included/required, as the filtering happens when
PHP parses and compiles a file for the first time. Xdebug needs to do it as this point, as this is also when
it analyses which paths can run, and which lines of an executable unit can not
be executed. Tagging executable units at this point, also means that the
filter does not have to run every time Xdebug wants to count a line to be
included in code coverage for example. It is therefore <b>important</b> to
set-up the filter <b>before</b> the code is included/required. This currently
can be best done through an auto-prepended file through PHP's
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file">auto_prepend_file</a> setting.
</p>
<p>
To set-up a filter that only does code coverage analysis for the
<code>src/</code> folder, you would call [FUNC:xdebug_set_filter] with:
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<div class='example'>
<code><pre>
&lt;?php
xdebug_set_filter(
	XDEBUG_FILTER_CODE_COVERAGE,
	XDEBUG_PATH_INCLUDE,
	[ __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "src" . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ]
);
?>
</pre></code>
</div>
<p>
With this filter set up, the code coverage information will only include
functions, methods and files which are located in the <code>src/</code>
sub-directory of the file in which this file resides. You can tell PHP to add
this prepend file by calling:
</p>
<pre>
php -dauto_prepend_file=xdebug_filter.php yourscript.php
</pre>
<p>
Or in combination with PHPUnit, when installed through Composer, with:
</p>
<pre>
php -dauto_prepend_file=xdebug_filter.php vendor/bin/phpunit
</pre>
<p>
The full documentation for the arguments to [FUNC:xdebug_set_filter] are
described on its own documentation page.
